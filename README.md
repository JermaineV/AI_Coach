# AI Communication Coach

This project aims to develop a platform that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist users in improving their communication skills for public speaking and interviews. 

**Features (In Progress):**

* Speech Recognition: Capture and analyze user speech for content and delivery.
* Text Analysis: Process user-provided text (e.g., job descriptions, presentation outlines) to understand context and generate relevant questions.
* Mock Interview Simulation: Simulate interview scenarios with AI-powered questions based on user input.
* Performance Analysis: Provide feedback on speech patterns, body language (future implementation), and content organization.

**Tech Stack:**

* Python (Programming Language)
* SpeechRecognition (Speech Recognition)
* NLP Libraries (To be determined - NLTK, spaCy)
* (Optional) OpenCV (Computer Vision for future features)

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
